# Advent of Code 2024

This repository contains my solutions for the **Advent of Code 2024** challenges. I will publish my solutions here after solving the daily puzzle and once the daily highscore leaderboard is complete, as per the event organizer's request.

## Sample Data and Puzzle Inputs

- **Sample Data:**  
  Sample data files, freely available on [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/), are included in this repository. However, I will not publish any part of the story, answers, or personal puzzle input data, in compliance with Advent of Code's rules.

- **Personal Puzzle Input:**  
  To solve your own puzzle, you need to create a file named **`Challenge.txt`** in the appropriate directory for the day. For example:
  - For Day 1, place your puzzle input file in:  
    **`data/Day01/Challenge.txt`**

## Sample Data Formatting

- **File Naming Convention:**  
  Sample files are named using the format:  
  **`Sample<NBR>_<ANSWER_PART1>_<ANSWER_PART2>.txt`**  
  - `<NBR>`: Sample file number.
  - `<ANSWER_PART1>`: Expected answer for Part 1.
  - `<ANSWER_PART2>`: Expected answer for Part 2.  

- **Usage Rules:**  
  - If a sample file is relevant for **both Part 1 and Part 2**, include expected answers for both parts, e.g.,  
    **`Sample1_11_20.txt`**  
    This means the expected output for Part 1 is `11` and for Part 2 is `20`.  
  - If the file should be used for only one part, use `X` as a placeholder for the other part. For example:  
    **`Sample1_11_X.txt`**  
    This file will only be used for Part 1, while Part 2 will be ignored for this sample.

## Running the Application

1. Place your **`Challenge.txt`** file or sample data in the respective day's folder under **`data/DayXX/`**.
2. Run the application. It will automatically read the input and evaluate the solution.

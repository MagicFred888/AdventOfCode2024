# Advent of Code 2024

I will publish my solution for the **Advent of Code 2024** here as soon as I have solved the challenge and the daily highscore is full, as requested by the organizer.

I have included sample data since it is freely available on https://adventofcode.com/, but I will not publish any part of the story and/or answer and/or personal puzzle data.

If you want to solve your puzzle, just create a file named **"Challenge.txt"** in the **data\DayXX** folder you want to solve and run the application again. So for day 1 the file must be like **data\Day01\Challenge.txt**

The sample data is formatted as **Sample<NBR>_<ANSWER_FOR_PART_1>_<ANSWER_FOR_PART_2>.txt** and must also be placed in the **data\DayXX** folder. 

If the sample can be used for part 1 and part 2, you can name it like **Sample1_11_20.txt** : it means that part 1 should give 11 and part 2 should give 20.
If you want the file to be ignored for a part, just replace the value with an X like **Sample1_11_X.txt**. In this case the file will only be used for part 1.
